# OpenASAR Install Scripts (macOS)
This repo includes some installer scripts I made for OpenAsar by [GooseMod](https://github.com/GooseMod)

## Usage
Download whichever script you need in [releases](https://github.com/singlekeycap/openasar-macos/releases), then run in terminal (you might need to run `chmod +x <script>`)

## Error Reporting
If you encounter any errors, please open an issue describing steps to reproduce and the bug that has occurred. I will get back to you ASAP.
